description: 'Edith Wharton''s contributions to literature went beyond her fiction:
  She was an influential writer and thinker on design as well. Reacting against heavy,
  ornate Victorian design, as well as the conspicuous consumption of her day, Wharton
  makes the case for a classical simplicity in home decor--one that grows from architectural
  necessity. Her co-author is eminent architect Ogden Codman, Jr.'
